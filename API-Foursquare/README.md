## Working with the Foursquare API (using Python)

######*Project conducted by*: San Diego State University
######*Report prepared by*: Jiue-An (Jay) Yang @ San Diego State University

#### Abstract
This technical note introduces the Foursquare API, which allows developer to connect to the Foursquare database for retrieval of users and venues information.  This technical note covers some details about using the API, from getting started with applying the API keys to using the API method and retrieving data.

There are many methods can be used from an endpoint application, however, this technical note will only focus on how to search and obtain information about venues with spatial parameters.  The data retrieved from Foursquare with the API has potential to be used for mapping and analyzing the accessibility to food.

This report covers the following items:
*Sign up for Foursquare account
*Register your Foursquare application
*Search for a Starbucks venue within 1000 meters radius of the San Diego State university.


This repository contains technical documents, exmaples, python codes of social media API. Besides providing the description of how to do a search by keyword, HDMA center at SDSU more focuses on how to do spatil query in Social media. For example,br 
> 1) what parameters of spatial query are used in social media API (ex: lat, lng, geonames, or radius?)
>
> 2) what are returned formats (ex: json, xml, or geojson) 
>
> 3) how to send a request by URL 
>
> 4) how to write a simple python code to send a request
